## Pre-requisites

Please follow the instructions from the [Installing Required Software](https://charlotte-cci-icc.github.io/itsc-2214-readings/labs/00_installing_req_software.html) textbook chapter or the instructions presented in class.

Also, please go through the [Using the Autograder](https://charlotte-cci-icc.github.io/itsc-2214-readings/labs/01_using_autograder.html) to understand how to use the autograder for your labs.

## Project Overview

There is a `Main` class with 12 methods. Methods are called `part0`, `part1`, etc.

The body of each method has comments that explain what the method needs to return. Your job is to write code to make sure it returns the correct value. There are tests you can run that will verify your method is working properly. Your grade will be determined by how many tests you pass. Each test or part is worth ~6 points.
