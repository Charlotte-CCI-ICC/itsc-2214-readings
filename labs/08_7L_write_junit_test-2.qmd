## Project Overview

In this lab, we are going to write tests for a `Comparable` interface implementation, and we are going to learn how to structure projects.

Here is what you want to do:

1. Create a folder called `src`. It stands for “source”, where we will place our source files. Folders can be created using this button.
2. Inside `src`, create a folder called `UnitTesting`. This is meant to represent a package called `UnitTesting`. We want every class to belong to a package, as it helps when test classes and source classes are of the same package.
3. Create a source class called `CoOrds.java` inside the `UnitTesting` package, copy the following inside of it:

    ```java
    package UnitTesting;

    public class CoOrds implements Comparable<CoOrds> {
        int x, y;

        public CoOrds() {
            x = y = 0;
        }

        public CoOrds(int X, int Y) {
            x = X;
            y = Y;
        }

        public int compareTo(CoOrds other) {
            if (x != other.x) {
                return x - other.x;
            } else {
                return y - other.y;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Create another source class called `Student.java` also inside the `UnitTesting` package. Copy the following inside of it:

    ```java
    package UnitTesting;

    public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
        String name;
        char grade;

        public Student() {
        }

        public Student(String n, char g) {
            name = n;
            grade = g;
        }

        public int compareTo(Student other) {
            if (grade == other.grade) {
                if (name.charAt(0) == other.name.charAt(0)) {
                    return 0;
                } else {
                    return name.charAt(0) - other.name.charAt(0);
                }
            } else {
                return other.grade - grade;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Create a folder called `test`. This is where we will place our test files.
6. Inside `test`, create a folder called `UnitTesting`. This is meant to represent a package called `UnitTesting`.
7. Create two classes here called `CoOrdsTest` and `StudentTest`. You can copy your `CalculatorTest` contents from lab 5L here, and then modify it to contain tests for `CoOrds` and `Student`, respectively.

It is essential that each class in this project belongs to the same `UnitTesting` package.

This is what it should look like, in the end:

```
.
├── src
│   └── UnitTesting
│       ├── Comparable.java
│       ├── CoOrds.java
│       └── Student.java
└── test
    └── UnitTesting
        ├── CoOrdsTest.java
        └── StudentTest.java
```

Once you’ve implemented tests for each, first make sure your tests are passing.

Once they are passing you can hit check answer to run mutation testing.

You CANNOT run mutation tests (via the autograder) if your tests aren’t passing. Mutation testing can only work on tests that pass.

## Rubric

- Project must compile, otherwise no grade.
- Complete JavaDoc for `UnitTesting.CoOrds` (5 points)
- Complete JavaDoc for `UnitTesting.Student` (5 points)
- No surviving mutants for `UnitTesting.CoOrdsTest` (20 points)
- No surviving mutants for `UnitTesting.StudentTest` (20 points)

Submissions will be manually reviewed by TAs. Your grade may change as a result.
