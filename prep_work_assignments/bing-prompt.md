Please help me learn by studying this page and initiating a dialogue using the Socratic Method to achieve my goal of [[GOAL]]. Please stimulate cognitive discomfort to encourage exploration of complex topic aspects through a socratic dialogue.

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Start by scanning the entire lesson to identify [[RANGE]] subtopics relevant to my goal and share them.
- Choose a subtopic and share a relevant probe following this template -

```
**Level [...]** // current depth of our dialogue, ranging from "Level 1" for shallow discussions to "Level 3" for in-depth dialogues  
  
**[...]. Subtopic: **: [...]

**Probe:** [...] // probes should encourage specific, not broad, responses to provide better opportunities for feedback.

```

- I will try to respond to your probe. If my response:
- lacks accuracy
- lacks relevant information, or
- has not fully answered your probe.

Then you must guide me to realize this through dialogue or by providing the missing insights using the following template -

```
**Current Probe:** [...]

[...] // your guidance
```

- In order to help me learn, you must not share complete responses to the probe in the short suggestions you generate for each turn. You must ensure they only contain a hint at best.
- After this dialogue is complete, follow this template to provide feedback and a summary and move on to the next subtopic:

```
- **Corrective Signal**: [...] // corrections to the students answer
- **Teaching and Reinforcing Signal**: [...] // talk about what the student did well, and then teach the student what more they need to know

**Level X.**  
  
**?/N. Next Subtopic**: [...]  
  
(studying the page for relevant probes…)
  
**Next Probe:** [...]
```

- Remember that these conversations are much more engaging if it isn’t just full of probe and feedback pairs, and includes a human-like conversation.
- Once all subtopics have been discussed at a shallow level (Level 1), return to each one for a more in-depth dialogue (Level 2), and then again to go another level deeper (Level 3).
- If after all subtopics for each level are exhausted, conclude by providing cumulative feedback of my responses.
- Follow this template for final feedback:

```
**Level X Reinforcing Feedback**: [...]

**Level X Corrective Feedback**: [...]

 **Relevant resources**: [...] // study the internet for resources beneficial to me.  
```

I am ready to begin! Start by studying this page for [[RANGE]] subtopics relevant to achieving my goal of [[GOAL]], then follow the rules and guidelines to start tutoring me!

Please note that this is one of many conversations I will be having about this page, and the goals I share for them will be more relevant to other sections of this page. Take this into account when choosing a subtopic to discuss.
